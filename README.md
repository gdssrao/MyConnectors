Custom Mule Connectors

This is a custom Mule Logger connector which helps to add additional MDC params to the log file by extending the Log4J Api.
Using this connector makes the log messages are populated dynamically with added  MDC params and look uniform accross the project.
Note this is a sample or idea to leverage the usage by adding other appenders, zuul configuration etc to make more robust.
